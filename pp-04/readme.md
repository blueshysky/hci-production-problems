## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://material.io/design/components/bottom-navigation.html#usage
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  For the navigation I feel like on mobile it's hard to press the links on the top when it's all clumped together.
  So, I was thinking of making tabs on the top of the page where the user can press on the tab rather than the small words.
  And when press the icon can light up and the rest of the tab are dimmed. That way the user knows which tab he press.
  I want to make the container larger so that people with big hands don't mistakenly press on the tab that they don't want.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#usage
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  The layout for the whole page seems like a big clucter of mess. There are just so much words that it makes looking at it difficult. So, for me to change this I though of doing the simplest thing, getting rid of the words and just do pop ups.
  But, I don't want to do the pop up on the main page but at the "cart" page. I also want to get rid of the big icon because it's in the way, instead leave the icon on the top right of the page.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://material.io/design/color/#color-theme-creation
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  The original site is monotoned with black and white. Seems kinda boring for people to look at, and it's a museum so it needs to be interesting like the stuff inside the museum. So, we can use light/cold color for the tabs and leave the icons to be white. Then we can leave the background to be light gray, but get rid of the grid lines from the orginal webpage.
