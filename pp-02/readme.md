1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=1030u0kq6fKOFJvuHpyzB5HKfe3
Your Rationale: I choose this color because for a new gaming platform most of the time there is this epic-ness that
when looking at the console the website looks cool as well. It's like there is the product there, but with the website
at this color I think that this would help advertising the console even more. This is similar to playstation website
where the color is dark and cool, so I try to follow that idea as well.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52x0u0kpAmGfvQemRvUFl5NtkfW
Your Rationale: For this I though that making the color closer to something more springtime, so like green.
But, I choose light green, or something that isn't that dark because I felt that dark green isn't right for a site about flowers
or gardening. Also, most of the time vegetation isn't that kind of color. So, by having this light green I think that
many tourist could associate this light green to gardening.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=31Q0L0kL+s-mfUxFfSdSWaHM5l-
Your Rationale: For these colors, I pretend that I was a little boy. And, in a child's shoes, I need to find colors that
is fun and attractive. So, colors that are simple and nice to look at are my go to colors. So, I went for something that is bright
and close to primary colors as best as I could because these colors is what a kid would start out learning.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=c493m3O3z0kqiGVcD+dnRTvrZwrk7Y4
Your Rationale: I chosen these colors because of films and movies depiction of what cybersecurity is.
So, colors that is dark and light blue would make sense in a cybersecuity course site. Not only that I went on a process of
elimination of what color doesn't seem fit. I first try out all the hot colors, and found it confusing of why those colors would
ever be fitted in a cyber security course. Because, tech and hot colors like red or yellow just doens't feel right in a tech site. Then I try cool color. I first tried to make purple fit in the site but that didn't work because it's just so dark that it felt like an eye sore. So, blue was the other color that I tried and it worked pretty good.
